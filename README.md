# Build a Scorecard Using Machine Learning with Python

This repository provides code and resources for building a credit scorecard using various machine learning techniques in Python. The project includes the implementation of Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Weight of Evidence (WOE), Information Value (IV), Binning, and Chi-square Binning methods for creating a credit scorecard.

## Overview

A credit scorecard is an essential tool for assessing the creditworthiness of individuals or entities. This project demonstrates how to create a credit scorecard using machine learning techniques and related methods. It includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and scorecard construction.
